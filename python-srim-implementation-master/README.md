**Depriciated** I have automated SRIM calculations in [this package https://gitlab.com/costrouc/srim-python](https://gitlab.com/costrouc/srim-python)

# PySrim

PySrim is a code written in python to simulate via Monte Carlo ion treveling through a target. The ions are stopped through the collisions of ions with the nucleus of an atom within the material and excitation of the electron clouds of each atom.
